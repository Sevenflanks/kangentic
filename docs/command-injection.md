# Command Injection

Kangentic injects per-column `auto_command` values and supported effort changes into a live agent session when a task moves between columns. Model changes set `needsRestartForModel` and are handled by the caller before any live writes. For ordinary `TerminalSubmitScheduler` (`src/main/transition-engine/terminal-submit-scheduler.ts`) bursts, regular live injection is prefixed with `Ctrl+C` while fresh-spawn bursts are not. OpenCode trailing live lane commands use the separate `wait-for-native-idle` path: same-process native-idle admission, user-input cancellation, and `TerminalSubmit.submitKeystrokes` (`src/main/pty/terminal-submit.ts`) with `sendCtrlC: false`. This document covers how the **command-injection** verification context confirms each chained command lands cleanly on the agent's TUI.

OpenCode 的初始內容走獨立私有 plugin 路徑。fresh launch 以 `OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG` 載入 packaged `kangentic-startup.mjs`，由 mounted TUI plugin 在 route API 可用時建立並直接導向 session；project-local `.opencode/plugins/kangentic-activity.js` 則保留 activity telemetry 與 resume bootstrap。

fresh 與 resume 使用不同 payload-path env，避免 TUI/server plugin 跨 Worker 搶同一私有檔案。fresh plugin 依序呼叫 flat v2 `session.create`、`route.navigate('session', { sessionID })`、`session.promptAsync`；resume server plugin 維持 legacy client 的 `session.get` 與 `promptAsync`。兩者皆不把 prompt 放進 argv、environment value 或 TUI config，也不以 sleep、poll、retry 或 `tui.session.select` 取代 route readiness。

## What gets injected (the settings delta)

`prepareInjectionPlan` (`src/main/transition-engine/injection-plan.ts`) decides whether a model
change requires restart and which supported `/effort` slashes a column transition emits by diffing
a **source** against a **target**:

- **Target** is the destination column's effective value: `task.<override> ?? toLane.<override> ?? project.default_<field> ?? null`.
  The project-default tier is read on both sides of the diff: without it, a task moving between
  two override-less columns on a project with a default model/effort set would read source = the
  applied project default (recorded at the last spawn) vs target = null, and spuriously
  restart/re-inject even though nothing actually changed.
- **Source** is the value the live session is *actually running at*, read from the session
  record's `applied_model` / `applied_effort` columns: `task.<override> ?? record.applied_<field> ?? null`.
  It is NOT the leaving column's config. The leaving column disagrees with reality after an
  in-flight ContextBar switch or a `kangentic.json` column-config edit, and is null on a move
  with no resolvable leaving-column - either case used to manufacture a redundant `/effort`
  injection even though the spawn/resume `--model` / `--effort` flags had already applied the value.
  A per-task override still wins for that field (source = target = pin, so no slash fires).

When supported effort changes to a concrete target, the returned `InjectionPlan` carries
`appliedSettings: { effort? }` for the emitted write. The `task-move` Priority 3c path and
`SWIMLANE_UPDATE` propagation persist it via `SessionRepository.updateAppliedSettings` after
scheduling the burst, so the session's recorded running value stays current and the *next*
transition diffs against the truth. Model state is recorded by spawn or resume with the resolved
launch overrides.

## Why verification exists

Column transitions can chain several commands in sequence: `/effort Y`, then a user-supplied `auto_command`. Without verification, an Enter key can be silently dropped by the TUI (autocomplete still showing, an overlay open, render frame skipped), causing the next command's text to concatenate into the previous prompt buffer. The result is a single combined entry like `<command-args>xhigh\n/code-review</command-args>` that quietly leaves the column's intended settings unapplied.

Time-based settles cannot detect this because the writes did succeed; only the input semantics broke. We need an **authoritative signal** from the agent that the command was processed as the discrete invocation we intended.

## The verifier contract

Adapters declare verification capability via the optional `getSubmissionVerifier` method:

```typescript
interface AgentAdapter {
  getSubmissionVerifier?(contextType: SubmissionContextType): SubmissionVerifier | null;
}

type SubmissionContextType = 'paste' | 'command-injection';

type SubmissionContext =
  | { type: 'paste' }
  | { type: 'command-injection'; text: string; agentSessionId?: string; cwd?: string; sentAt?: number };

type SubmissionVerifier = (context: SubmissionContext) => Promise<boolean>;
```

For the `'command-injection'` context, the verifier receives the literal command text plus session metadata (the captured `agent_session_id`, the session `cwd`, and `sentAt` - the wall-clock timestamp of the most recent Enter the verifier should match against) and returns `true` once it confirms the command was processed. `sentAt` advances on each retry-Enter so stale transcript entries from previous attempts cannot satisfy the current verification.

## Claude's JSONL-polling implementation

Claude is the only adapter that currently provides a `'command-injection'` verifier. Claude Code writes every successful slash invocation to its session JSONL transcript as a `local_command` system entry whose `<command-name>` matches the slash and whose `<command-args>` matches exactly what was sent. The verifier (`src/main/agent/adapters/claude/slash-command-verifier.ts`) tail-scans this file for an entry matching both fields exactly:

- Match `<command-name>` against the slash (e.g. `/model`).
- Match `<command-args>` against the literal args we sent (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`).

A combined-args entry like `claude-opus-4-7\n/effort xhigh` is **not** a match by design -- that is the failure mode we want to detect and retry.

The scan is bounded by a 50ms tolerance window around the send time (`Date.now()` at the moment of the Enter), so the polling cadence (~25ms) lands on the expected entry within ~50-100ms in the happy path.

## Retry semantics in `TerminalSubmit`

`TerminalSubmitScheduler.scheduleKeystrokes` hands a chain of commands to `TerminalSubmit.submitKeystrokes`, which delivers them with the following timing:

0. **Optional leading `Ctrl+C`** (`sendCtrlC` opt-in, default true). The scheduler passes `sendCtrlC: false` when `opts.freshlySpawned` is true so fresh-spawn auto_command bursts skip the interrupt entirely. Regular live-injection paths (supported effort changes and board column edits on a running session) keep `sendCtrlC: true` so they can interrupt mid-thinking before delivering the new write. OpenCode trailing live lane commands are a separate `wait-for-native-idle` path: they use `sendCtrlC: false` and are cancelled if user input arrives before admission.
1. Initial write of command text + Escape + Enter (text → `\x1b` → `\r`).
2. **If the command falls within `verifiedPrefixLength`**: poll the verifier every 25ms for up to 400ms. If unconfirmed, re-fire `\r` and try again. After 4 retries, log a warning, send Ctrl+C to clear the prompt buffer, and continue with the next command.
3. **Otherwise** (no verifier, or command falls outside the verified prefix): wait a fixed 500ms settle window before the next command.

### Fresh-spawn concatenation failure mode

The `Ctrl+C` opt-out exists to prevent a distinct concatenation failure mode from the chained-command one above. Fresh-spawn auto_command paths just consumed the CLI prompt arg (e.g. `claude -- "<task>...</task>"`) and the CLI is mid-render of that first user turn. On Windows ConPTY + Ink, sending `Ctrl+C` during that render lands in a state where the just-submitted prompt and the follow-up keystrokes get rendered as one user message: `</task>/test` glued together. Suppressing the leading `Ctrl+C` lets the keystrokes queue cleanly behind the in-flight turn and submit as a distinct second user message.

對 OpenCode 而言，Auto-command 只允許 already-running active writable compatible Main Session 的 later live path。它必須等待稍後相符的 root-native clean idle evidence，採 `sendCtrlC: false`，並在 user-input cancellation 時停止；generic public idle、child idle 或 timer 完成都不能授權。fresh、resume、handoff、restart、isolated、no-active lifecycle cases 都 finalizes a skip。ordinary Task prompt 與 continuation prompt 保持 separate，OpenCode plugin 的初始 payload transport 不會承接 Auto-command。Non-OpenCode existing legacy command-injection behavior remains intact.

An action-backed spawn runs its own prompt and still finalizes the central Auto-command disposition.

The `verifiedPrefixLength` distinction is critical: the deterministic adapter-emitted `/effort Y` write from `getInjectionSequence` is safe to verify because we know exactly what JSONL entry to expect. A trailing user-supplied `auto_command` is **not** verified: it may not produce a matching JSONL entry the verifier recognizes, and retry exhaustion would drop the user's intended action. So we let auto-commands sail through with a time-based settle.

## When to use `'paste'` vs `'command-injection'`

| Context | Caller | What gets verified | Latency |
|---------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| `'paste'` | `TerminalSubmit.submitContent` (browser captures, single auto-command paste) | "the agent acknowledged this prompt" | 100-500ms |
| `'command-injection'` | `TerminalSubmit.submitKeystrokes` (chained slash commands) | "this exact command was processed as a discrete invocation" | 50-150ms typical, ~2s worst case |

The two contexts solve different problems: `'paste'` confirms one-shot paste submissions of arbitrary user prompts, while `'command-injection'` confirms each link in a multi-command chain landed cleanly. They share an interface (`getSubmissionVerifier`) so adapters declare what they support per context, and the renderer/IPC layer never has to branch on agent name.

Paste acceptance evidence is evaluated after Enter. It is distinct from initial-prompt delivery: OpenCode's plugin claims the private payload and uses the generated SDK, rather than authorizing a PTY paste from a TUI readiness signal.

**OR-combine vs poll-and-retry.** The two contexts also differ in how the engine consumes the verifier:

- `'paste'` runs the verifier **in parallel** with the activity-event listener and post-`\r` data path. The first signal to resolve wins. A verifier resolving `false` does not short-circuit the fallbacks - they remain active for the rest of the wait window. This matches the "best-effort confirmation" model: a verifier strengthens evidence but cannot weaken the existing fallback path.
- `'command-injection'` runs the verifier in a **tight poll loop** inside `TerminalSubmit.pollWithRetries`. On each iteration the verifier is invoked with the current `sentAt`; if it returns `false`, the loop sleeps `pollMs` and retries. Past the retry interval (with no confirmation), Enter is re-fired and `sentAt` advances. This matches the "deterministic chain" model: each command must be confirmed before the next.

## Per-adapter support matrix

| Adapter | `'paste'` | `'command-injection'` |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Claude | `null` (time-based fallback) | JSONL-polling verifier |
| Codex / Gemini / Qwen | `null` | `null` |
| OpenCode / Copilot / Aider | `null` | `null` |
| Cursor / Droid / Kimi / Warp | `null` | `null` |

When an adapter returns `null`, the caller falls back to:
- `'paste'`: activity event or any post-`\r` data byte (within 3s).
- `'command-injection'`: a fixed 500ms inter-command settle.

A non-Claude adapter could implement `'command-injection'` verification once its CLI exposes a comparable structured signal (e.g. a CLI-emitted JSONL transcript with command markers). Until then, time-based settles are the safest universal default.
