# Session Lifecycle

This document describes the full session state machine in Kangentic, covering how Claude Code CLI sessions are spawned, queued, suspended, resumed, and recovered.

## State Machine

There are two separate state representations:

- **`SessionStatus`** -- in-memory runtime state of a `ManagedSession` inside `SessionManager`. Values: `running`, `queued`, `exited`, `suspended`.
- **`SessionRecordStatus`** -- persisted in the SQLite database as a `SessionRecord`. Values: `running`, `queued`, `suspended`, `exited`, `orphaned`.

The in-memory `SessionStatus` does not include `orphaned` (that is a DB-only concept discovered on next launch). Both types include `queued` - the DB record is created with `status: 'queued'` at spawn time and promoted to `running` when a concurrency slot opens.

```
                  +----------+
                  |  queued  |
                  +----+-----+
                       |
              slot opens (SessionQueue promotes)
                       |
                       v
+------------+    +----------+    +-----------+
| suspended  |<---| running  |--->|  exited   |
+-----+------+    +----+-----+    +-----------+
      |                |                ^
      |                | app crashes    | killed while queued
      |                v                |
      |           +----------+    +-----+----+
      +---------->| orphaned |<---|  queued   |
   (recovery)    +----------+  (app crashes)
```

### States

| State | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `queued` | Both | Waiting for a concurrency slot to open |
| `running` | Both | PTY is live, Claude Code CLI process is active |
| `suspended` | Both | PTY killed, but session ID and files preserved for resume |
| `exited` | Both | Process exited naturally or was killed; terminal state |
| `orphaned` | DB only | App crashed while session was running; discovered on next launch |

### Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| `queued` | `running` | Concurrency slot opens, `SessionQueue` promotes |
| `queued` | `exited` | Session killed while still queued |
| `running` | `suspended` | Task moved to Done or `auto_spawn=false` column |
| `running` | `exited` | Task moved to To Do (full cleanup via `cleanupTaskSession`) |
| `running` | `exited` | Process exits naturally or is killed |
| `running` | `orphaned` | App crashes, leftover `running` DB record found on next launch |
| `queued` | `orphaned` | App crashes, leftover `queued` DB record found on next launch |
| `suspended` | `running` | Task moved to active column, resumed via `--resume` |
| `suspended` | `exited` | Replaced by a new session on resume (`retireRecord`) |
| `orphaned` | `running` | Session recovery on project open |
| `orphaned` | `exited` | Recovery dedup, or failed recovery (`retireRecord`) |
| `orphaned` | `suspended` | Pause-on-restart setting upgrades a crashed session (`markRecordSuspended`) |
| `exited` | `running` | OS-killed (abnormal `exit_code`) session resumed by recovery on project open (`getInterruptedExited`) |
| `exited` | `suspended` | Interrupted-exited record CAS-upgraded by recovery (non-target / non-auto-spawn / auto-resume-off), or a PTY exit during app shutdown (onExit hardening) |
| `running` | `suspended` | App shutdown race: PTY exits while `isShuttingDown()` (onExit hardening keeps it resumable) |

## Spawn Flow

### Spawn entry points

Every way a task agent can be spawned routes through one of TWO chokepoints, and both run the
shared spawn preamble `runSpawnPreamble` (`src/main/transition-engine/spawn-preamble.ts`): lock
the Advanced overrides on a first-ever spawn (`lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn`), then resolve
the target agent (`resolveTargetAgent`), in that order. Permission mode is resolved by the same
module's `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` (a lane forcing `plan` always wins, else task -> lane
-> global). Guarded by root `CLAUDE.md` and
`tests/unit/spawn-entry-point-parity.test.ts`.

| Entry point | Trigger | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Task move (Phase 3 deferred spawn) | drag into an auto_spawn column | `spawnAgent` (`src/main/ipc/helpers/agent-spawn.ts`), `settingsSourceLane` = source lane |
| Create into a spawn column | New Task dialog / `TASK_CREATE` | `spawnAgent`, `fromSwimlaneId: '*'` |
| Backlog promote | promote from Backlog panel | `spawnAgent`, `fromSwimlaneId: '*'` |
| MCP create (`kangentic_create_task`) | `autoSpawnForTask` | `spawnAgent` |
| Unarchive (single + bulk) | Completed Tasks restore / `TASK_UNARCHIVE` | `spawnAgent`, `skipPromptTemplate` + `suppressAutoCommand` (recovery move) |
| Startup crash recovery | project open, `resumeSuspendedSessions` | `prepareAgentSpawn` (`session-startup/prepare-spawn.ts`) |
| Startup reconcile | project open, `autoSpawnTasks` | `prepareAgentSpawn` |

In-place restarts of an existing session (`SESSION_RESUME`, `restartSessionForSettingsChange`)
call the engine directly; they are not first-spawn entry points. Transient Command Terminal
sessions bypass all of this (not task agents).

### Engine spawn (board-driven path)

1. `spawnAgent` runs the spawn preamble, executes the transition's actions, then falls back to
   `resumeSuspendedSession` if no action created a session.
2. `TransitionEngine.executeSpawnAgent()`:
   - Detect the agent CLI via the resolved adapter
   - Resolve permission mode via `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` (lane `plan` always wins,
     else task pin -> lane -> global)
   - Determine CWD (worktree path or project path)
   - Pre-populate `~/.claude.json` trust for worktree paths
   - Check for previous suspended session (can resume?)
   - If resuming: use existing `agent_session_id` with `--resume`, no prompt
    - If fresh: generate an adapter-native `agent_session_id` only when the adapter accepts caller-supplied IDs, then include the prompt
    - Generate a Kangentic PTY session ID and create `.kangentic/sessions/<ptySessionId>/`; this is also the `sessions.id` primary key and is distinct from `agent_session_id`
   - Build agent CLI command via `CommandBuilder`
   - Call `SessionManager.spawn()`
3. `SessionManager.spawn()`:
   - Check concurrency limit; queue if full (returns `queued` placeholder)
   - If under limit, call `doSpawn()`:
     - Kill any existing PTY for the same task (orphan dedup)
     - Resolve shell and arguments (platform-specific)
     - Spawn PTY via `node-pty`
     - Start status file watcher (100ms debounce)
     - Start events file watcher (50ms debounce)
     - Set up output handler (16ms batched flush, 512KB scrollback)
     - After 100ms delay, write CLI command to PTY stdin

## Queue

- Configurable max concurrent sessions (`config.agent.maxConcurrentSessions`, config default: 8). The `SessionQueue` constructor initializes with a hardcoded limit of 5; the actual config value is applied via `setMaxConcurrent()` when config loads at startup.
- When the limit is reached, the session receives a `queued` status placeholder.
- When a running session exits or is suspended, `notifySlotFreed()` promotes the next queued entry.
- Reentrancy-safe: a `_processing` flag prevents concurrent promotion, and a `_dirty` flag ensures re-iteration if the queue changed during a spawn await.

## Suspend and Cleanup

Session teardown varies by target column:

- **To Do** (role=`todo`) -- full cleanup via `cleanupTaskResources()`: kills the PTY, deletes session files and DB records, and removes the worktree. When `git.autoCleanup` is enabled, it also deletes the task branch. Moving back to an active column starts a fresh session and creates a new worktree and branch as needed.
- **Done** (role=`done`) -- suspends session (preserves for resume via `SessionManager.suspend()`), archives task. The DB record is marked `suspended` so the session can be resumed if the task is later unarchived.
- **Any column with `auto_spawn=false`** -- suspends session (same as Done, but without archiving).

### What is preserved on suspend (Done / auto_spawn=false)

- `agent_session_id` (for `--resume` on next spawn)
- Worktree directory and branch
- Session files on disk (`status.json`, `events.jsonl`, `settings.json`)
- Scrollback buffer in memory

### What is destroyed on To Do cleanup

- PTY process (force-killed)
- Session files on disk (deleted)
- All session DB records for the task (deleted)
- In-memory caches (usage, activity, events) for the session

### SessionManager.suspend() flow

1. Close file watchers
2. Null out file paths (prevents `onExit` cleanup from deleting files)
3. Emit synthetic `session_end` event
4. Clear subagent depth tracking
5. Mark status as `suspended`
6. Kill PTY
7. Emit status change
8. Notify queue (slot freed)

## Resume

When a suspended task moves to an active column:

- Command: `claude --settings <path> --resume <agentSessionId>` (no prompt)
- New PTY spawned with scrollback carried over from previous session
- New session DB record inserted, old record marked `exited`
- The destination column's settings are re-applied as CLI flags on the resume
  command: `--permission-mode` (lane override, else global default), `--model`,
  and `--effort`. On an active same-agent session, a concrete model change
  suspends and respawns; supported effort changes apply live, unsupported
  concrete effort changes respawn, and permission-only changes leave the live
  session running.
- A plan-exit auto-move (Planning -> Executing), triggered when the user
  approves the plan (the `ExitPlanMode` tool completes, not when the agent
  merely invokes it), preserves its continuation prompt
  ("Proceed with implementing the approved plan.") as the resumed session's
  first message when the existing continuation flow qualifies. For OpenCode,
  a skipped Auto-command never replaces or erases that continuation prompt;
  non-OpenCode existing legacy behavior remains intact.
- The **first move OUT of Done** (the recovery / restore move, whatever the
  destination column) resumes the session WITHOUT injecting the destination
  column's `auto_command`. Restoring a Done task is usually to inspect the
  session or ask a question, so the column automation (e.g. `/merge-pull-request`)
  sits idle until the next move. This is unconditional and matches crash
  recovery, which also resumes command-free. Every Done-out path goes through
  `spawnAgent`'s `suppressAutoCommand`: the unarchive handlers
  (`TASK_UNARCHIVE` / `TASK_BULK_UNARCHIVE`) set it on their `spawnAgent`
  calls, and a non-archived Done-out move (MCP `move_task`, legacy rows) gets
  it from `handleTaskMove` when `fromLane.role === 'done'`. Model / effort /
  permission-mode settings still apply on the recovery move. The next move
  injects per column config as usual.

### OpenCode Auto-command

OpenCode Auto-command is separate from the ordinary Task prompt and is delivered only to an active writable compatible Main Session through the native-idle live path with `sendCtrlC: false` and user-input cancellation. Fresh, resume, handoff, restart, isolated, and no-active lifecycle cases finalizes a skip while their normal lifecycle continues. Ordinary Task prompt, continuation prompt, and action prompt remain intact; non-OpenCode existing legacy behavior remains intact.

An action-backed spawn runs its own prompt and still finalizes the central Auto-command disposition.

## Crash Recovery (Session Recovery)

On project open (`src/main/transition-engine/session-startup/`):

1. **Prune orphaned worktrees** -- delete tasks whose worktree directories were removed externally
2. **Mark crash recovery** -- leftover `running` DB records become `orphaned` (skip records with live PTYs to handle re-entrant calls)
3. **Collect candidates** -- all `suspended` + `orphaned` agent records, plus OS-killed **interrupted-exited** records (any `session_type` except `run_script`). An interrupted-exited record is `status='exited'` with an *abnormal* code (`exit_code != 0`, cross-platform: Windows `1073807364`, Unix `137`/`143`/`130`), a captured `agent_session_id`, that is the latest record for its `(task, session_type, isolation)` group (`getInterruptedExited`). This catches a hard shutdown (OS restart, power loss, SIGKILL) where the PTY died and the onExit handler recorded `exited` before the clean-quit path could mark it `suspended`. Clean exit 0 is excluded so a deliberate `/exit` is never resurrected on startup.
4. **Deduplicate per `(task_id, isolated_swimlane_id)`** -- keep only the latest record for each parallel session (see [Isolated Sessions](#isolated-sessions-per-column-session-model)), mark older same-session duplicates as `exited`. A task may hold multiple sessions; only same-session duplicates are retired.
5. **Select the current session** -- per task, recover ONLY the session matching the task's current column strategy (`resolveIsolatedSwimlaneId`). Non-target sessions are preserved (an orphaned or interrupted-exited one is CAS-upgraded to `suspended`) so re-entering their column later continues their own conversation.
6. **Filter** -- skip tasks in non-auto-spawn columns (an interrupted-exited record there is CAS-upgraded to `suspended` for future resume, mirroring move-to-Done), skip user-paused sessions (`suspended_by = 'user'`), skip missing CWD, skip deleted/archived tasks
7. **Resume or respawn** (isolation-scoped via `getLatestForTaskByTypeAndIsolation`):
   - Suspended/orphaned/interrupted-exited with `agent_session_id` -- use `--resume` (attempts to restore conversation)
   - No session ID -- fresh `--session-id` with prompt from matching `spawn_agent` action
8. **Reconcile** -- spawn fresh agents for tasks in auto_spawn columns with no session at all (skips user-paused tasks); fresh rows are tagged with the column's `isolated_swimlane_id`

## Isolated Sessions (Per-Column Session Model)

A task can run on multiple parallel, independently-resumable sessions. Two orthogonal column fields (set on the Automation tab of the Board Manager) control the behavior; the pure rules live in `src/main/transition-engine/session-isolation.ts`:

- **`session_target`** (`main` | `isolated`, default `main`) - which session track a task runs on. `main` is the task's shared main conversation (resumed as the task moves between normal columns); `isolated` is this column's own separate, context-isolated session, keyed by the swimlane id. Resolved by `resolveSessionTarget` / `resolveIsolatedSwimlaneId`; the discriminator is `sessions.isolated_swimlane_id` (`NULL` = main, swimlane id = isolated).
- **`session_spawn_strategy`** (`create_or_resume` | `always_spawn_new`, default `create_or_resume`) - what to do with that track on entry. `create_or_resume` resumes the track's session if one exists, else spawns it; `always_spawn_new` always spawns fresh, retiring the prior session for that `(task, target)`. Resolved by `resolveForceFresh`, whose default is **context-aware**: an isolated column defaults to `always_spawn_new` (an independent pass each entry), a main column to `create_or_resume` (continuity), unless `session_spawn_strategy` is set explicitly.

The four combinations:

| `session_target` | `session_spawn_strategy` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | `create_or_resume` | Resume the task's main session, or start it (the default) |
| `main` | `always_spawn_new` | Restart the main session from scratch each entry (reset-main) |
| `isolated` | `create_or_resume` | Resume this column's isolated session, or start it (a persistent isolated track) |
| `isolated` | `always_spawn_new` | A fresh, independent pass every entry (the reviewer archetype) |

Both fields are enums so future tracks/strategies need no schema migration.

**An isolated session is context-isolated.** It does NOT inherit the main session's conversation. For non-OpenCode legacy adapters, pairing `session_target: isolated` (with the default `always_spawn_new`) and `auto_command: /code-review` yields an independent isolated reviewer that judges the current diff without the generator's reasoning trail. OpenCode isolated entry finalizes an Auto-command skip while the ordinary Task prompt and continuation prompt remain intact. (This is distinct from Claude Code's own `/fork` / `--fork-session`, which *inherit* the conversation; we deliberately do not.) "Restart the conversation" within a session is otherwise left to the agent's native `/clear` / `/compact`.

**One active PTY per task** is preserved. The worktree is shared across a task's sessions (same `task.worktree_path`), so an isolated session's edits are real and persist; the main session sees the changed tree but not the isolated conversation.

**`always_spawn_new` applies on column entry only.** An app restart / pause-resume of an in-progress session still resumes it (the recovery path is unaffected), so a crash never discards active work.

Lifecycle on task move (`task-move.ts`, the session switch branch inside Priority 3):

- **Enter an isolated column from a live main session**: suspend the main session (preserve `agent_session_id`), then Phase 3 spawns/resumes the isolated session. Non-OpenCode legacy adapters keep their existing configured delivery; OpenCode finalizes an Auto-command skip. With `always_spawn_new` (the isolated default) it spawns fresh each entry, retiring the prior pass.
- **Leave an isolated column for a normal column**: suspend the isolated session (resumable), then Phase 3 resumes the **main** session.
- **Reset-main / recycle**: an `always_spawn_new` column forces a fresh spawn on its target track even when the live session is already on that track, so the switch fires on `resolveForceFresh(toLane)`, not only on a target change.
- The target + spawn policy are derived from the destination column in `resolveSpawnOverrides`, threaded through `SpawnOverrides.isolatedSwimlaneId` / `SpawnOverrides.forceFresh` into `resolveSpawnIntent` (which retires the prior record on a forced-fresh entry) and `sessionRepo.insert`. The terminal tab badges an isolated session as "Isolated" vs "Main".

## Shutdown

On app close, the `before-quit` handler calls `syncShutdownCleanup()`, which is fully synchronous. The `suspendAll()` method exists in `SessionManager` but is **never called during shutdown** -- it is async and would break the synchronous requirement.

The actual shutdown sequence (`syncShutdownCleanup()` in `src/main/index.ts`):

1. Cancel all pending command injections
2. List all in-memory sessions with `running` or `queued` status
3. For each running record, call `captureSessionMetrics()` (synchronous: in-memory cache read + better-sqlite3 writes) so cost / tokens / duration / `tool_breakdown` / `compaction_count` are flushed to the DB before the PTY is killed. The function writes to BOTH the `sessions` row (`SessionRepository.updateMetrics`) and, when `usage` is defined, to a `usage_history` row (`UsageHistoryRepository.recordSessionUsage`) so lifetime period totals survive any subsequent task deletion. Without this step every clean app close loses in-flight metrics for any session that had not yet checkpointed. (The shutdown path uses the synchronous snapshot only; the async transcript-token refinement, `refineTranscriptTokens`, runs only on the exit/suspend/move paths, never here.) A periodic snapshot timer (`startMetricsSnapshotTimer`, ~45s) also runs this same capture for live sessions during normal operation so an app/OS kill bounds the loss to one interval; it is stopped synchronously at the top of `syncShutdownCleanup`.
4. Mark each running record `suspended` (with `suspended_at` timestamp and `suspended_by = 'system'`) so sessions can resume on next launch. Queued records are marked `exited` since there is nothing to resume.
5. Call `SessionManager.killAll()` which force-kills all PTYs immediately (no graceful `/exit`, no waiting)
6. Clean up session files and clear in-memory session maps
7. Delete ephemeral project from index (if applicable)
8. Close all database connections via `closeAll()`
9. Let Electron's normal quit proceed (tears down Chromium child processes)

A hard failsafe timer (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, 6 seconds) runs as a backstop in case Electron's shutdown hangs.

Sessions are resumable on next launch via `--resume <agent_session_id>` from the saved DB record. The 2-second graceful `/exit` window is intentionally sacrificed to keep shutdown synchronous and prevent zombie processes.

## Terminal Ownership Handoff

- Each PTY session spawns exactly one Claude Code CLI process.
- The bottom panel and the modeless task-detail windows share that process, one xterm per session at a time.
- `dialogSessionIds: string[]` in `SessionStore` lists every session owned by an open task-detail window. It replaced the scalar `dialogSessionId` once task detail became modeless and windows can stack.
- When a window claims a session: the panel unmounts that session's xterm instance.
- When the window releases it: the panel recreates xterm from the PTY scrollback buffer.
- This prevents duplicate xterm instances from sending conflicting resize calls.

## Project-Scoped Session State

Sessions from non-active projects must not interfere with the active project's terminal panel, activity icons, or store state. This is enforced at three levels:

1. **IPC event forwarding** -- All session events (`data`, `usage`, `activity`, `event`, `status`, `exit`) include the session's `projectId`. The renderer filters events by comparing against the current project.
2. **Cache getters** -- `getUsage`, `getActivity`, and `getEventsCache` accept an optional `projectId` parameter. When provided, `SessionManager` returns only data for sessions belonging to that project.
3. **Store scoping** -- `syncSessions()` fetches usage and events scoped to the current project, but activity unscoped (sidebar badges need cross-project data). On project switch, `activeSessionId`, `dialogSessionIds`, `openTaskId`, `sessionUsage`, and `sessionEvents` are cleared; `sessions` and `sessionActivity` are preserved for the sidebar. A generation counter invalidates any in-flight `syncSessions()` calls from the previous project, and a snapshot-based merge preserves IPC-delivered status updates that arrive during the async gap.

**Sidebar exception:** Activity state (`thinking`/`idle`) is always forwarded and stored regardless of project, so the sidebar can show badge counts for all projects. Auto-focus and sync triggers are gated to the current project only.

## Transcript Capture

PTY output is captured for two purposes: terminal display (via the scrollback buffer) and persistent transcript storage (via `TranscriptWriter`).

`TranscriptWriter` (`src/main/pty/buffer/transcript-writer.ts`) receives raw PTY data, strips ANSI escape sequences, and debounces writes to the `session_transcripts` table every 30 seconds, flushing early if a session's pending buffer exceeds 256KB. This provides a clean, searchable text transcript of the session without terminal formatting noise.

The PTY transcript is a persistent, searchable terminal record. It is separate from adapter-native conversation history and is not assembled with git or metrics into handoff input.

## Cross-Agent Handoff

When a task changes agents, a handoff runs only if a prior session exists and the destination lane enables `handoff_context`. The source adapter then attempts to locate native history from that session's adapter-native `agent_session_id` and CWD. Native history stays in adapter-specific user or project storage, which can be a file, project-level history, or database depending on the adapter and CLI version.

1. Kangentic inserts a `handoffs` audit record with source and target metadata plus a nullable `session_history_path`.
2. The target starts a new PTY session. Its initial prompt receives XML instructions with the optional native-history path, not a synthesized transcript, git diff, metrics packet, or `handoff-context.md` file.
3. After a successful spawn, Kangentic records the target PTY session ID in the audit row.

The target agent is not required to read the reference. If lookup finds no path, the audit record still exists with a null path and the prompt advises the target to inspect `git log` for prior changes. Parsed structured transcripts and `session_transcripts` remain separate retrieval sources.

## Output Streaming

- PTY `onData` accumulates into a per-session buffer.
- A 16ms flush interval (~60fps) emits buffered data via IPC `session:data`.
- A 512KB scrollback ring buffer per session supports terminal restoration.
- **Repaint-settled scrollback sampling.** A session spawns at a default 120x30; on a cold launch
  an auto-resumed PTY sits at that size until a card opens and the renderer fits it wider. When a
  width-changing resize fires, a full-screen agent TUI repaints its frame asynchronously in
  response to SIGWINCH. So `getScrollback` waits for that repaint to land and quiesce before
  sampling (`PtyBufferManager.waitForResizeRepaint`), so a terminal restored right after a resize
  replays the frame at the fitted width instead of a stale narrow one. The wait arms only when the
  scrollback shows a TUI (a `\x1b[2J` clear) and is bounded by a max-wait ceiling, so a missing or
  slow repaint can only delay a first paint, never hang the read. An actively streaming session
  never quiesces, so the wait also settles EARLY the moment a full-frame repaint marker (`\x1b[2J`
  or `\x1b[H`) lands in the bytes appended after the resize, outside any open synchronized-output
  frame - instead of burning the whole ceiling and sampling mid-repaint. STACKED resizes (a second
  width change while the previous repaint is still pending, e.g. rapidly closing and reopening a
  task detail ping-pongs the PTY between the dialog and bottom-panel widths) disable the
  marker-only settle - the first marker may be the previous width's late repaint - and require
  marker AND quiesce, falling back to the ceiling while streaming. A resize that arrives before the
  PTY exists (the renderer mounts before the auto-resume spawn lands) is stashed and applied at
  spawn, so the PTY starts at the fitted size and no corrective resize is needed.
- **DEC private mode and alt-screen re-assert on replay.** `xterm.reset()` on the renderer wipes
  every DEC private mode xterm is tracking, and the original mode-set bytes usually scroll out of
  the 512KB scrollback window on a long-running session. `PtyBufferManager` tracks DEC private
  input/reporting modes (DECCKM, mouse tracking, bracketed paste, ...) from the live stream and
  re-asserts them as a prefix on `getScrollback` (#313). Alt-screen (mode 1049/47/1047) is tracked
  separately as `inAltScreen` and re-asserted with its own `\x1b[?1049h` prefix, gated on the
  session currently being in the alt buffer - a classic (normal-buffer) session's replay is
  unaffected, but a fullscreen-TUI session's replay now paints into the alt buffer instead of the
  normal buffer (previously the cause of a cursor left visually disconnected from the TUI frame). A
  synchronized-output frame (mode 2026) left open by a mid-frame sample is closed with a trailing
  `\x1b[?2026l` so it cannot stall the renderer's ~1s safety timeout.
- **Hold, not drop, live output across a renderer-side replay.** While a scrollback replay is in
  flight (`scrollbackPendingRef`), the renderer's incoming-write queue HOLDS (retains, does not
  ack) rather than drops live PTY bytes, and flushes them in order once the replay's `afterWrite`
  completes. This closes a window where a live diff (e.g. a fullscreen TUI's selection-highlight
  redraw) could be silently discarded during a reattach. Only the loading overlay continues to
  drop-and-ack (its window can span the whole agent startup). A generation-aware `afterWrite` and a
  bounded watchdog timer additionally guard against a stale or stuck replay leaving
  `scrollbackPendingRef` true indefinitely, which would otherwise drop all live output forever.
- **Replay veil for a warm mount.** For an already-running session, `TerminalTab`'s launch overlay
  never shows (`terminalReady` starts true), so the whole mount-time fit -> replay -> refit ->
  held-byte-flush sequence used to paint live, occasionally as a visible flash. `TerminalTab` now
  covers the terminal with a veil (fixed terminal-background color, no spinner or transition) from
  mount until `useTerminal` fires its first `onScrollbackSettled` notification, so only the settled
  frame is ever shown. Every settle path (afterWrite, IPC-rejection catch, watchdog) funnels
  through one `settleScrollback` chokepoint, so the veil always lifts.

## Transient Sessions

Transient sessions are ephemeral Claude Code terminals spawned from the command bar (Ctrl+Shift+P). They differ from task-bound sessions in several ways:

- **No task association** - run at the project root with no Kanban task
- **No DB persistence** - no session record in the database
- **No resume capability** - killed on close, not suspendable
- **No queue** - spawned immediately regardless of concurrency limits

### Spawn Flow (`SESSION_SPAWN_TRANSIENT`)

1. Optionally checkout a target branch (falls back to current branch on failure)
2. Create a session directory at `.kangentic/sessions/<transientTaskId>/` for bridge files
3. Build Claude CLI command via `CommandBuilder` (with MCP server if enabled)
4. Call `SessionManager.spawn()` with `transient: true`

### Kill Flow (`SESSION_KILL_TRANSIENT`)

1. Remove the session from `SessionManager` (kills PTY)
2. Delete the session directory from disk (best-effort cleanup)

Transient sessions are tracked with a `transient_session_spawn` analytics event.

## AbortSignal Pattern

When a task moves rapidly between columns (e.g. drag-and-drop corrections), spawns from earlier transitions can become stale before they complete. The transition engine uses `AbortSignal` to cancel in-flight spawns:

1. Each task move creates an `AbortController` for the transition
2. If the same task moves again before the previous transition completes, the old controller is aborted
3. The `AbortSignal` is threaded through `executeTransition()`, `executeAction()`, and `executeSpawnAgent()`
4. At each async boundary (CLI detection, worktree creation, PTY spawn), the signal is checked via `signal?.throwIfAborted()`
5. If aborted, the spawn stops immediately - no PTY process is created

The `isAbortError()` utility in `src/shared/abort-utils.ts` provides a type guard for distinguishing abort errors from real errors in catch blocks.

## Terminal Paste Strategy

Terminal paste operations use xterm.js's built-in `terminal.paste()` method, which handles bracketed paste mode for the PTY. The paste path is unified:

- **Ctrl+V / Cmd+V** - intercepted by a custom key handler, reads clipboard, calls `terminal.paste()`
- **Context menu paste** - follows the same clipboard-read-then-paste path
- **Built-in xterm paste suppressed** - a `paste` event listener on the xterm helper textarea prevents the browser's native paste from double-sending text through xterm's `onData` handler

This ensures consistent behavior across keyboard shortcuts and context menu paste.

## Terminal Copy Strategy

Terminal copy operations write to the OS clipboard through the main process
(`clipboard:writeText`), which is synchronous and focus- and permission-independent.
`navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is deliberately not used: it rejects with `NotAllowedError`
when the document lacks focus, which is exactly the state during a native context-menu click and
when a TUI app emits its copy sequence. The copy paths are:

- **Ctrl+C with a selection / Ctrl+Shift+C** - the custom key handler reads the xterm selection,
  cleans soft-wraps, and writes it via the IPC.
- **Context menu Copy** - the native menu dispatches a `terminal-copy` event; the handler writes
  the selection via the same IPC.
- **OSC 52** - a TUI app (e.g. Claude Code's copy-on-select) copies by emitting
  `ESC]52;c;<base64>BEL`. A write-only OSC 52 handler decodes the payload and writes it via the
  IPC. Read requests (`Pd` is `?`) are ignored so a TUI can never read the user's clipboard back
  out of the terminal.
- **Scrollback replay** - recorded scrollback may contain OSC 52 sequences from an earlier copy;
  the replay path strips them so restoring a session (dialog reopen, resize, respawn) never
  clobbers the user's current clipboard.
