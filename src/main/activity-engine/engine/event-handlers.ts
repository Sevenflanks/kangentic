 *                         subagent's spurious inner-loop Stop and is ignored.
 * - `BackgroundShellStart` first closes any in-flight pending tool whose
 *                         id matches `event.toolId` (a foreground Bash that
 *                         Claude auto-backgrounded on timeout - the tool
 *                         moved to the background rather than ending), then

 *                         or anonymously (empty / command-string fallback).
 *                         When PreToolUse + PostToolUse fire as a pair,
 *                         the second arrival "promotes" an anonymous
 *                         slot to a named one to keep total count constant.
 * - `BackgroundShellEnd`  decrements the named shell if the id matches,
 *                         else drains anonymous (ONLY when the end carried
 *                         no id at all - an id-shaped-but-unmatched end is
