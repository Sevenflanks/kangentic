 * deliberately NOT `sessionManager.write` (no submit semantics) and NOT
 * `submitKeystrokes` (slash-command delivery; a 2KB payload would take ~80s).
 *
 * The guards here are circuit breakers against unattended token spend - two

 * unobstructed, so the discriminator is send FREQUENCY, not chain depth.
