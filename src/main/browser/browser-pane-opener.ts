/**
 * Opens and closes a task's embedded Browser pane on behalf of the
 * `kangentic_browser_open_pane` / `kangentic_browser_close_pane` MCP tools.
 *
 * Why this module exists at all: pane open state is renderer-owned
 * (`browserOpenTasks` in the session store) while the MCP server is
 * main-process, so opening a pane crosses the process boundary the "wrong" way.
 * The shape that keeps that honest:
 *
 * 1. **Main validates everything it can.** Current project, the per-project
 *    browser gate, the task row, and the URL are all main-checkable, so there is
 *    no need for the renderer to report a refusal back. That is what lets the
 *    push stay fire-and-forget instead of introducing a correlated
 *    request/response channel, which `src/main/` deliberately does not have.
 * 2. **The completion signal is the pane REGISTRY, not an acknowledgement.**
 *    Registration is renderer-driven and lands on the guest's `dom-ready`. A
 *    reply saying "I set the flag" would not mean the pane is driveable, and
 *    returning on it would recreate the `no-pane-open` race this tool exists to
 *    remove.
 * 3. **The wait is bounded and ends in `withGuest`.** Resolving through the same
 *    chokepoint every driving tool uses is what makes "registered AND driveable"
 *    true rather than merely claimed.
