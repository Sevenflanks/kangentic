 * handshake completes or after the session is torn down; a routine ~2-minute
 * re-handshake (bridge-session.ts) keeps the existing secretstream until the
 * new one is derived, so it does NOT drop events. A dropped event is not
 * recovered - there is no 'established' re-push, so the phone catches up by
 * re-issuing its read-* requests (each of which returns a fresh snapshot),
 * not by this side replaying missed deltas. `BridgeSession.sendMessage` also
 * throws once torn down; the try/catch keeps a transient send failure from
 * escaping an event-listener callback.
 *
 * An oversize frame is the one failure worth surfacing: it is not transient
 * (retrying sends the same over-budget payload again) and, unlike a torn-down
 * session, the phone has no other signal that this event was dropped.
