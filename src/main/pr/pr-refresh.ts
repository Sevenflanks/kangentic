 * PR for a still-unlinked task that has a live worktree (e.g. an agent created
 * the PR mid-session on a renamed branch and no other trigger caught it). Runs
 * fire-and-forget on project open/switch and on a periodic timer (see
 * pr-refresh-scheduler.ts).
 *
 * Reuses the `linkPR` backbone unchanged and NON-FORCE on purpose: non-force
 * re-resolves open/draft/null PRs (so open -> merged is caught), skips terminal
 * merged/closed (no wasted `gh` call), and coalesces within the 60s per-task TTL.

/**
 * A task is worth a background sweep when its PR can still change or be found:
 *   - a non-terminal linked PR (`pr_number`) - state can change off-app;
 *   - a live worktree (`worktree_path`) - an actively-worked task whose PR may
 *     have been created but not yet linked (the discovery case); the worktree's
 *     live HEAD branch resolves the PR even after the agent renamed the branch.
 *     Only active tasks have a worktree (To Do clears it, Done reclaims it), so
 *     this stays a small bounded set, further bounded by the per-task 60s TTL and
 *     the global `gh` concurrency cap.
 * Terminal merged/closed PRs never change and are skipped first, as are tasks
 * sitting in a To Do lane (To Do resets a task, so there is no PR to link there -
 * the same gate `autoLinkPRForTask` applies to every implicit trigger). A task
 * with none of these has nothing to resolve. (`tasks.list()` already excludes
 * archived tasks.) `head_sha` is deliberately NOT an anchor here: nearly every
 * historical task carries one, so it would make the sweep unbounded. Neither is a
 * PR URL in the description - see the ladder comment in `pr-linking.ts` for why
 * scraping prose stamped cited PRs onto unrelated tasks.
