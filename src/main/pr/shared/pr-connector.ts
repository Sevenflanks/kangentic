 * PR connector contract - the platform-agnostic interface every hosting provider

 * (`adapters/<provider>/`) can import the types without forming an import cycle.
 *
 * Verb taxonomy across the PR subsystem:
 *   detect*  - parse a PR reference from text / scrollback (no network)
 *   resolve* - authoritative provider lookup (CLI / API)
 *   link*    - resolve + persist to a task (see pr-linking.ts)
 *   refresh* - bulk re-link across a project (see pr-refresh.ts)
