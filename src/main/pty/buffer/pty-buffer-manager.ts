 * Repaint-settle window for getScrollback (see waitForResizeRepaint).
 *
 * When the terminal geometry changes (cols OR rows), a full-screen agent TUI
 * (Claude, Codex) repaints its frame asynchronously in response to SIGWINCH. A
 * getScrollback that samples the buffer in the gap between the resize and that
 * repaint would replay a frame laid out for the OLD geometry - the stale-frame
 * bug this settle closes. So getScrollback waits for the repaint bytes to land
 * and quiesce before sampling, bounded so a missing repaint can never hang the
 * read. Width armed this settle first; rows-only changes (a bottom-panel height
 * drag, a vertical-only window resize) arm it too, since measured live
 * (2026-07-31, real Claude CLI in a preview, 12/12 trials idle and streaming):
 * the unarmed sample beat the SIGWINCH repaint every time and replayed the
 * old-row-count frame, and the rows repaint landed 21-122ms after the resize
 * ALWAYS carrying a full \x1b[2J erase, so the marker below settles it early
 * instead of riding the MAX_WAIT deadline.
 *
 * An actively streaming session never quiesces, so the wait also settles EARLY
 * the moment a full-frame repaint marker lands in the bytes appended AFTER the
 * resize. The marker is the \x1b[2J erase ONLY. \x1b[H cursor-home was tried and
 * removed: TUIs emit it for ordinary partial updates (a live session showed 169
 * cursor-homes to 56 erases), so it settled on a spinner tick and sampled the
 * pre-resize frame. The scan is offset-tracked via
 * pendingRepaintScrollbackLength, and the marker only counts while no
 * synchronized-output frame (DEC 2026) is open - that flag aligns the sample to
 * a frame boundary. Without the early settle, a streaming session always burned
 * the full MAX_WAIT and then sampled mid/pre-repaint anyway.
 *
 * STACKED resizes (a second geometry change while the previous repaint is still
 * pending - e.g. rapidly closing and reopening a task detail ping-pongs the
 * PTY between the dialog and bottom-panel widths) disable the marker-only
 * early settle: the first post-resize marker can be the PREVIOUS geometry's
 * repaint arriving late, and sampling on it replays a stale frame that
 * the real repaint then visibly corrects. When pendingRepaintStacked is set,
 * settling requires the marker AND a quiesce (both repaints landed and
 * stopped), falling back to the MAX_WAIT deadline while streaming. An arm
 * older than MAX_WAIT does not stack the next one: its repaint has landed or
 * never will (this settle itself stops waiting at MAX_WAIT), so an unconsumed
 * old arm - a height drag nothing sampled after - must not slow the next open.
 *
 *  - QUIESCE: no new data for this long counts as "the repaint has landed".
 *    ~3 flush ticks (16ms each), long enough to bridge a multi-chunk redraw.
 *    Required IN ADDITION to the marker on a stacked resize; it is NOT a
 *    standalone fallback, because "some bytes, then quiet" is satisfied by a
 *    spinner tick. A marker-less repaint rides the MAX_WAIT deadline instead.
 *  - MAX_WAIT: hard ceiling from wait entry. A geometry change with no repaint
 *    (or a genuinely slow one) adds at most this to a first paint.
 *  - STALE: a pending-repaint stamp older than this is treated as settled - the
 *    repaint has long since landed, so sample immediately.
 *  - POLL: settle poll cadence, matched to the flush tick.
