/**
 * Tracks what the USER has typed into a session's prompt and not yet sent.
 *
 * Why this exists: auto_command injection needs to know whether it is about to
 * type into an empty prompt or on top of someone's half-written message. The
 * reported bug is the second case - `instead can we` plus an injected
 * `/pull-request` submitted as one message, which both loses the command and
 * confuses the agent.
 *
 * Reading the prompt directly is not available to us: the main process sees a
 * raw ANSI byte stream, not a rendered screen, and the rendered screen lives
 * in a renderer that may not even be showing this session. But we DO see every
 * byte the user types, because renderer keystrokes, dictation, and the mobile
 * bridge all funnel through `SessionManager.write`. Accumulating those is a
 * direct measure rather than an inference.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT LOAD-BEARING FOR CORRECTNESS. The clear decision is safe
 * without it (a warm session always clears), so a stale or missed ledger entry
 * degrades the message the user sees, never the delivery itself. It matters in
 * exactly one place where it does change behavior: the fresh-spawn path, whose
 * prompt is empty at SPAWN time but not necessarily at DELIVERY time, because
 * delivery waits for the agent to come alive and the user can type during that
 * window. There the ledger only ever ADDS a clear that would otherwise be
 * skipped, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * Accuracy limits, accepted: a draft Claude Code restores itself (history
 * recall) was never typed through us and is invisible here; text typed into a
 * TUI overlay rather than the prompt counts when it should not. Both are
 * tolerable precisely because of the paragraph above.
