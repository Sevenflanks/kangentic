/**
 * Bounded ring of terminal LIFECYCLE events in the main process, for the
 * devtools terminal-state route.
 *
 * The terminal failures worth debugging are ordering problems spread across two
 * processes: a resize, an async agent repaint, a scrollback sample, and a replay
 * write, where the bug is which one happened first. Neither side can see that
 * alone, and reconstructing it from screenshots or after-the-fact state is
 * guesswork - the settle's decision in particular (did it wait for the repaint,
 * or give up on a deadline?) left no trace at all and had to be deduced by
 * building a separate harness.
 *
 * Records only LOW-frequency lifecycle events, not per-chunk PTY data: a few
 * pushes per terminal mount. The renderer keeps its own ring
 * (terminal-grid-registry) and the route merges the two by timestamp, which avoids
 * a new IPC channel for a dev-only diagnostic.
 *
 * Writes are gated on `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`. The ONLY reader is the inspection
 * server under `src/devtools/`, which production dead-code-eliminates - so in a
 * packaged build this ring would fill forever with bytes nothing could ever read.
 * If a shipped reader is ever added (a "copy diagnostics" affordance for a bug
 * report), drop the guard; until then it is pure cost.
