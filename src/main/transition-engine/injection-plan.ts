/**
 * Per-agent translation of a column-level model/effort change (and an
 * optional auto_command) into a chained sequence of writes plus an
 * appropriate verifier - i.e. the input TerminalSubmitScheduler needs to
 * actually push the writes onto the PTY.
 *
 * Naming convention across the stack:
 * - "sequence" = pure data, agent-declared (adapter.getInjectionSequence,
 *   adapter.getExitSequence). The adapter names a sequence by the
 *   lifecycle event that drives it (injection / exit), not by the
 *   downstream consumer.
 * - "plan"     = the assembled artifact (sequence + verifier) handed to
 *   the executor. The plan is what gets injected.
 * - "scheduler" / "burst" = execution layer (TerminalSubmitScheduler).
 *
 * Centralizes what `task-move.ts` and `board.ts` would otherwise both
 * build by hand:
 *
 * 1. Ask the destination adapter for the writes needed to apply settings
 *    deltas (`getInjectionSequence`).
 * 2. Append the column's auto_command (already interpolated) if any.
 * 3. Ask the adapter for a per-command verifier
 *    (`getSubmissionVerifier('command-injection')`) bound to this task's
 *    session transcript via the captured `agentSessionId` and `cwd`.
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing to inject (no settings delta, no
 * auto_command). Callers pass the result straight to
 * `terminalSubmitScheduler.scheduleKeystrokes(task.id, sessionId, plan.sequence, { verifier: plan.verifier, verifiedPrefixLength: plan.verifiedPrefixLength })`.
