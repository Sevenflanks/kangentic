 * configured it: task override -> the lane the task lived in at config time
 * (`settingsLane`) -> project default (global permission mode for Permission).
 * The DESTINATION column's settings never leak into the locked contract - the
 * user never saw them in the dialog. A destination lane forcing
 * `permission_mode: 'plan'` still wins at spawn resolution (see

 * differ in exactly one case, and it is the case the user cares about: Agent
 * Override with all four fields left on inherit stores no pins at all, yet still
 * means "lock these four to what I was shown". A task in Column Settings mode is
 * untouched - it keeps following column/project defaults for its whole life.
 *
 * "First ever spawn" = no session record exists AND task.agent is still null.
 * task.agent is set once, at first successful spawn (see transition-engine.ts),
 * and is NOT cleared by a To-Do reset (cleanupTaskResources wipes session rows
 * but never touches task.agent), so a task that spawned once, was reset to To
 * Do, and is redragged forward is correctly not treated as fresh.
 *
 * Mutates the passed `task` object in place (in addition to persisting) so the
