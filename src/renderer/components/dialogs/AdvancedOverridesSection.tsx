/**
 * The "how this task runs" section, shared between New Task creation
 * (`NewTaskDialog`) and existing-task edit (`TaskDetailEditForm`).
 *
 * It offers ONE either/or choice, rendered as two selectable cards:
 *   - **Column Settings** - the task's agent, model, and effort come from each
 *     column it moves through. Nothing is pinned. A Profile picker INSIDE this
 *     branch chooses which set of column settings applies: Default (the board as
 *     configured) or a named Board Profile's alternate ladder.
 *   - **Agent Override** - one agent / model / effort / permission pinned for
 *     the task's whole life, ignoring every column.
 *
 * The branch is named for the MECHANISM, not for the picker inside it: the
 * mechanism is the board's column configuration, and a Profile is one variant of
 * it. Labelling the branch "Profile" implied the Default path was a profile too,
 * which it is not.
 *
 * The two were previously stacked as separate controls (a Profile select, then
 * an "Agent Override" disclosure) and read as two independent settings rather
 * than as alternatives. They are mutually exclusive at the storage layer
 * (`applyProfileExclusivity` in `task-repository.ts`), so the affordance has to
 * say so: picking one branch clears the other's fields here, exactly as the
 * repository would on write.
 *
 * The mode is explicit state, NOT derived from "are any fields set" - and it is
 * PERSISTED (`Task.run_mode`), not just held for the life of one mount. A user
 * who selects Agent Override and picks no value would otherwise snap straight
 * back to the Column Settings branch: within a mount while typing, and across a
 * save, because "override, everything inherited" and "column settings" store an
 * identical set of nulls.
 *
 * Resolution + locking contract (Agent Override branch):
 *   - The inherit state (empty string) shows the concrete value it resolves
 *     to today as a MUTED placeholder (the bare value, no "Inherit (...)"
 *     framing, no clear-X) - the muted weight alone signals "inherited, not
 *     pinned". A concrete pick renders at full weight with a clear-X.
 *     Leaving a field on inherit stores no override, so a later
 *     column/project-default change still applies - until first spawn (see
 *     below). Applies to all four fields (Agent/Model/Effort/Permission).
 *   - A concrete pick wins over the column for the task's lifetime; column
 *     moves cannot change it (see `resolveTargetAgent` and the cross-agent
 *     guards in `task-move.ts`). If the task has ANY of the four fields set
 *     when it spawns for the very first time ever, the other
 *     (still-inherited) fields are locked too, to exactly the values this
 *     dialog displayed - resolved against the lane the task was configured
 *     in, never the destination column
 *     (`lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn` in `spawn-preamble.ts`). So a
 *     value that already matched its inherited default gets locked, not
 *     silently left dynamic, and the whole Advanced tab is the task's
 *     contract from then on. One exception: a column that forces
 *     `permission_mode: 'plan'` always wins over the task's (picked or
 *     locked) permission while the task is in that column - plan mode is a
 *     genuine safety guarantee, not just an ordinary column default (see
 *     `resolveEffectivePermissionMode` in `spawn-preamble.ts`).
 *
 * Behaviour notes:
 *   - The Agent picker renders DISABLED, not hidden, when only one agent is
 *     `found`. Same reasoning as the Profile select above it: a locked field
 *     still names the agent this task will run on, and it keeps the edit
 *     pencil beside it - the card's only route to Settings > Agent, where all
 *     four of these defaults are set - in one place on every machine.
 *   - Changing the agent resets model + effort because the previous picks
 *     were valid for the previous agent's capability matrix.
 *   - The whole section is hidden when the task has nothing to override at
 *     all: no second agent to pick, no model override support, no effort
 *     levels, and no permission modes. Callers should still render this
 *     component and let it no-op via `null`.

                      OUTSIDE AppLayout's `currentProject` gate, so an edit form can
                      outlive its project; disabling on that rather than no-opping
                      in the handler keeps the button from looking live when the
                      click would do nothing. */}
