/**
 * The running version's release notes, shown once on the first launch after the
 * version changes and reopenable from the status-bar version pill.
 *
 * The post-restart counterpart to ReleaseNotesDialog, which can only run while an
 * update is downloaded and pending. After the relaunch `pendingUpdate` is null,
 * so nothing could surface the notes at all - not for a user who restarted
 * straight from the toast, not for one whose update installed on a normal quit,
 * and not for a fresh, manual, or Linux install the updater never touched.
 *
 * A sibling rather than a mode of ReleaseNotesDialog: the two share only the
 * GitHub link and a one-line markdown body, while their triggers, lifecycles,
 * titles, and footers all differ. This one must NOT offer "Restart to update" -
 * there is nothing pending to install.
 *
 * Notes come from the build itself (see lib/baked-release-notes.ts), so this
 * needs no network and no update manifest. `useWhatsNewOnLaunch` owns the
 * once-per-version decision; this component only renders.
 *
 * Mounted in AppLayout so it appears regardless of sidebar state.
 *
 * Rocket rather than Sparkles for the icon: Sparkles means AI/semantic
 * everywhere else in the renderer (NameFromPromptButton, the search palette's
 * "matched by meaning" badge, MemoryTab), and release notes are human-authored.
 * It is also distinct from the pre-restart dialog's CloudDownload, so "update
 * ready" and "update applied" never read as the same thing.
 *
 * The title is brand plus version, like a release-page header, rather than
 * "What's new in vX": RELEASE_NOTES.md opens with its own `## What's New`
 * heading, so that phrasing echoed itself on two adjacent lines. The title names
 * the release and the body's own headings section it.
