  // checklist, clicks a step (which does NOT dismiss) and then adds a second project is still
  // inside their first run and gets it there too. It stops for good once the list is non-empty.
  //
  // The walkthrough teaches the app, not a repo - every step ("Create a task", "Drag it to
  // Planning", "Open the task") is app-generic - so the auto-open decision is install-scoped.
  // It used to be keyed on `onboardedProjectIds.includes(...)`, which meant a newly added
  // project, having a brand-new id, was by definition un-dismissed: adding a 17th project to
  // an established install replayed the whole walkthrough.
  //
  // Emptiness of that same list is the install-scoped signal, and it is non-empty by exactly
  // three routes, all of which mean "not a first run": App.tsx's one-time backfill finding at
  // least one project the user already had, a real dismissal, or all five steps completed.
  // The per-project `includes` check is gone rather than kept alongside this - it is strictly
  // subsumed (a member implies a non-empty list), so leaving it would be dead code inviting a
  // future reader to restore per-project scoping.
  //
  // Two guards remain, each load-bearing. `onboardedProjectIds === undefined` means the
  // backfill has not run yet, and opening before it does would flash the checklist at existing
  // users on projects they have used for months; it also covers cold start, where the backfill
  // waits on `loadConfig()` and `loadProjects()` together (App.tsx) while `loadCurrent()` races
  // ahead un-awaited, so `currentProject` can land first. The session-scoped ref covers the
  // other direction: clicking a step closes the dialog WITHOUT marking the project onboarded
  // (the user is engaging, not dismissing), so without it this effect would immediately reopen
  // the dialog over the screen it just sent them to. It stays keyed by project id rather than
  // collapsing to a plain boolean because the empty-list window is not necessarily one project
  // long: while the list is still empty, arriving at a DIFFERENT project earns its own single
  // auto-open, and a boolean would swallow it.
  //
  // Only config-backed, monotonic values belong here: the ref is a one-way latch, so a single
  // frame reading a stale value latches irreversibly. `projects.length` is NOT such a value
  // (App.tsx's --cwd auto-open sets `currentProject` before its `loadProjects()` resolves).
  //
  // Accepted trade-off: this forecloses a per-project "reset onboarding" (removing one id from
  // a list that still holds others reads as retired). That is coherent with onboarding being
  // install-scoped, and the dev-only title-bar button already reopens the checklist by hand.
