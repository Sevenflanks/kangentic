 * The Agent Monitor: a full-surface overlay between the title bar and status bar,
 * aggregating every live and recently-finished agent session across ALL projects.
 *
 * It deliberately reuses StatsPage's `z-[42]` rather than claiming a new slot in
 * the documented ladder (board windows 40, stats 42, command terminal 45, dialogs
 * 50, toasts 60). That is safe precisely because the two are mutually exclusive:
 * AppLayout closes one when the other opens, so they can never be mounted at
 * once. Do not widen the ladder for this surface.
 *
 * The Command Terminal layer is ABOVE this one (45), so AppLayout hides it when
 * the monitor opens. That is not tidiness: without it the monitor mounts under the
 * terminal's backdrop, which swallows every click, so the surface is present but
 * inert and the terminal appears to refuse to close. Its PTYs keep running, so
 * reopening the layer reattaches them.
 *
 * The pop-out button detaches it into its own OS window (PopOutMonitorRoot,
 * sharing MonitorBody so both hosts behave identically). AppLayout suppresses
 * this overlay whenever that pop-out is open.
