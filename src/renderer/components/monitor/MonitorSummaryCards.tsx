/**
 * The at-a-glance row above the controls.
 *
 * Proportioned after the usage dashboard's HERO tiles rather than its compact
 * ones - big numeral, roomy padding, a supporting line underneath - because on a
 * developer's monitor there is height to spare and a 48px tile with a 12px
 * numeral wastes it. No sparkline: these are instantaneous counts, not series,
 * and a fake trendline would imply history the tile does not have.
 *
 * Each tile carries its state's own tone, and only when the count is non-zero:
 * an amber "Needs you" reads as a call to action, whereas an amber ZERO would be
 * an alarm about nothing.
 *
 * Sized, not stretched. Filling the width with `grid-cols-4` gave four 640px
 * tiles of mostly empty card on a 2560px display, which is why the first version
 * of this band was pulled.
