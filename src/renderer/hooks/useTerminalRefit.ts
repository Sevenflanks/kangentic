 * growing) silently clipped the TUI's bottom rows.
 *
 * Unified debounced resize mechanism. One timer, two entry points:
 * - ResizeObserver debounces at 200ms (handles drag without scrollback
 *   eviction: timer resets every frame during drag, fires once after).
 * - terminal-panel-resize event uses 50ms (faster for explicit triggers
 *   like sidebar resize, dialog edit-mode toggle, drag mouseUp), 0ms for
 *   deferContainerResize hosts, or a synchronous fit for
 *   immediatePanelResize hosts.

 *
 * Window-manager terminals defer container-driven fits: the window manager
 * owns sizing and dispatches a single settle-debounced terminal-panel-resize,
 * so rapid snap/maximize/restore resizes the PTY once (one clean SIGWINCH).
 *
 * While a window-manager imperative resize gesture is in progress (seam drag,
 * footprint resize, 8-handle window resize) the observer fires per frame as
 * the frame's DOM box is rewritten. Refitting per frame would send a SIGWINCH
 * per frame, and a full-screen TUI re-emits its whole banner on each - stacking
 * duplicates in scrollback. Suppress the per-frame refit during the gesture; the
 * store commit on release dispatches a single terminal-panel-resize that refits
 * once. The gate is OFF for container-only changes (Changes/Browser pane toggle,
 * the Command Terminal's ContextBar growing), so those still refit normally.
