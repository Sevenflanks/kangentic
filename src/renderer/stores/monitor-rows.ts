/**
 * Row-identity reconciliation for the Agent Monitor snapshot.
 *
 * `MONITOR_CHANGED` is pushed (debounced 250ms, and only while some renderer holds
 * a live `monitor:subscribe` registration) whenever a session is spawned, changes
 * status, or exits, and the payload crosses the IPC boundary by structured clone.
 * That means EVERY row object is a fresh identity on every push,
 * even when nothing about it changed. Applied naively, that is a guaranteed store
 * write on a 250ms cadence for as long as session events flow, and with the monitor
 * open it cascades: the body's `useShallow` selector fails, the `units` memo
 * re-derives (filter + sort + group + chunk), and `React.memo(MonitorCardInner)`
 * fails for every visible card because `row` alone is a new reference. Each of those
 * cards then re-runs `stripMarkdown` over the task description.
 *
 * So the snapshot is merged rather than assigned: a row that is structurally
 * unchanged keeps its previous object, and when no row moved or changed the whole
 * array keeps its previous identity. The store can then return its state object
 * untouched, which zustand treats as "no update" and does not notify at all - the
 * same discipline `applyActivity` already uses for a single-row patch.
 *
 * The comparison is structural and key-driven rather than a hand-listed field set,
 * so a new field on `MonitorSessionRow` is covered the moment it is added instead of
 * silently defeating the reuse. Depth is bounded because the row's own nesting is
 * shallow by construction: `labels` is a string array, `activityReason` is a flat
 * union whose only non-scalar member is `ids`, and `lastEvent` is flat.
