/**
 * Agent Monitor store: the cross-project aggregate view's open/closed state, its
 * rows, and the user's persisted view preference.
 *
 * Three data paths, deliberately:
 *   - `attach()` / `detach()` bracket an open monitor. Attach registers this
 *     renderer with main - which builds and pushes MONITOR_CHANGED only while at
 *     least one renderer is subscribed - and seeds the rows from the snapshot
 *     the handshake returns, so opening is one round trip.
 *   - `loadSnapshot()` pulls the full cross-project snapshot from main without
 *     touching the subscription (the board-driven refetch and the HMR resync).
 *   - `applyActivity()` patches a single row in place from the SESSION_ACTIVITY
 *     push, which already flows unbuffered and cross-project. This is the common
 *     case (an agent starting to wait on you) and it costs no round trip at all.
 *   - `applyPeeks()` does the same for live terminal output (MONITOR_PEEK). Unlike
 *     the other two this stream is subscribe-gated, because it is the only one
 *     with a standing cost in main; see useMonitorPeekSubscription.
