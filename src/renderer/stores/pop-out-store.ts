/**
 * Mirrors which pop-out windows are currently open, keyed by popOutInstanceKey. Main
 * is the source of truth (its own window registry); this store hydrates once via
 * loadOpen() and stays live via the popOut:changed push (App.tsx wires onChanged).
 *
 * Only meaningful in the MAIN window: this is what lets the title bar / in-app
 * surfaces know a surface is detached and flip their trigger to "focus" instead of
 * "open", and suppress the in-app overlay/dialog/pane render (strict mutual
 * exclusivity). A pop-out window itself never reads this store.
 *
 * HMR: instance-pinned (Pattern E) + re-synced via loadOpen() in App.tsx's
 * vite:afterUpdate (Pattern B). tests/unit/hmr-resync.test.ts enforces both.
