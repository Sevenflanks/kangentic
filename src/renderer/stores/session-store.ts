 * (`onActivity`, `onUsage`, `onEvent`) may have delivered a fresher
 * value during the async gap between fetching the cache and applying
 * it; we don't want syncSessions to clobber that.
 *
 * Why not the simpler `{ ...cached, ...current }`: that variant
 * preserves entries that no longer exist in `cached`, leading to
 * indefinite leaks of `sessionActivity[id] = 'thinking'` (and
 * matching usage/events) for sessions the engine has already
 * dropped. HMR re-runs syncSessions on every renderer reload, so
