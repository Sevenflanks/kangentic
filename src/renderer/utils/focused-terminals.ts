/**
 * Focused-terminal registry: which sessions the renderer last published to main
 * as focused, and a per-session edge for the moment one regains focus.
 *
 * Why this exists, separately from `parked-terminals.ts`:
 *
 * Main forwards PTY data over IPC only for sessions in its focused union
 * (`SessionManager`'s `onFlush` gate). Everything else accumulates silently in
 * the scrollback ring, which is fine as long as SOMETHING repaints the grid when
 * the session starts being watched again. Until now the only catch-up was
 * `onTerminalReveal`, which fires on the PARKED edge - so the repair covered
 * only sessions that lost focus BY being parked.
 *
 * `deriveFocusedSessionIds` drops sessions for reasons that have nothing to do
 * with parking: a task detail owned by a detached monitor window
 * (`remotelyOwnedSessionIds`), the bottom panel being hidden, the command bar
 * closing on transient sessions. Each of those left a session unfocused, and
 * therefore un-fed, with no path back to a correct grid until an unrelated
 * resize or remount happened to repaint it.
 *
 * Focus loss is the strictly wider condition (parking implies unfocus, not the
 * reverse), so this edge is the general repair and the reveal edge is the
 * special case. Both are kept: only parking additionally makes the renderer's
 * incoming queue ack-and-discard, so the two registries answer different
 * questions and neither subsumes the other.
 *
 * Edge-triggered like the parked registry: republishing an unchanged set fires
 * nothing, so the steady-state cost is one Set comparison per publish.
