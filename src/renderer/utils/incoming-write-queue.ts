 * Bounded queue for INCOMING PTY data on its way into xterm.
 *
 * The renderer is a single thread shared by every xterm, the React board, and
 * all input. Writing a multi-MB burst to xterm in one synchronous
 * `xterm.write(data)` call monopolizes that thread and freezes the UI. This
 * queue instead writes the data in capped slices, pacing each slice on
 * `xterm.write`'s completion callback so the event loop runs (input, React,
 * paint) between slices.
 *
 * It also closes the backpressure loop: every consumed slice is acknowledged
 * back to the main process via `ack`, which decrements main's per-session
 * in-flight counter and resumes a paused PTY. Slices that are intentionally
 * DROPPED (scrollback replay or an overlay owns the screen) are still acked -
 * otherwise the PTY would stay paused forever on bytes the renderer discarded.
 *
 * Mirrors the main-side `src/main/pty/write-queue.ts` chunk-and-yield shape.
