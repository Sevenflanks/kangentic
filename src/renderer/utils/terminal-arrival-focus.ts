/**
 * Who may take keyboard focus when a terminal ARRIVES.
 *
 * A terminal "arrives" when it finishes mounting or replaying: the deferred-init
 * `focus()`, the mount-time scrollback replay, and any reload the host did not opt
 * out of. Those are programmatic events, not user gestures, and more than one can
 * land in the same handful of frames - opening a task detail evicts the bottom
 * panel's selected session, so the panel mounts a fresh terminal for a DIFFERENT
 * session at the same moment the detail window mounts its own. Both then fetch
 * scrollback, which main delays 150-400ms while the agent's TUI repaint settles.
 * Every one of those paths used to end in an unconditional `xterm.focus()`, so
 * whichever replay resolved LAST won, and the user's keystrokes went to whichever
 * agent that happened to be.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: at most one terminal takes focus on arrival, and which one is
 * decided by user-intent STATE, never by replay order or rAF order. Each tier
 * below is EXCLUSIVE - a tier that resolves an answer decides, allowing if it
 * matches and DENYING if it does not. It never falls through to a lower tier.
 * Non-exclusive tiers degrade straight back into a race, because two terminals
 * arriving in the same frame would both find themselves permitted.
 *
 * Genuinely user-initiated focus does NOT come through here and stays
 * unconditional: pointer-down on a window frame, a file drop on a terminal, the
 * maximize/restore re-homing, and the imperative `focus()` those use.
 *
 * Naming note: "focused" is already taken in this codebase. `focused-terminals.ts`
 * owns the PTY-STREAM focused set (which sessions main forwards bytes for, several
 * at once), and `focused-sessions.ts` derives it. This module is about KEYBOARD
 * focus, and exactly one terminal can hold that, so it uses its own vocabulary.
 *
 * Known boundary, deliberately not closed: click into the bottom panel's xterm
 * body (rather than its tab) while a detail window still holds `focusedWindowId`,
 * and that window's terminal then arrives - tier 2 allows the steal. It is narrow,
 * because the window must have just opened for its terminal to still be arriving,
 * which means the user just clicked it. Closing it would need a claim on
 * panel-pane pointer-down, which brings a stale-claim edge of its own.
