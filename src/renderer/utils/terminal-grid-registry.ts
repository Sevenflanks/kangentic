/**
 * Dev-only registry of the xterm instances currently mounted in this renderer,
 * so the devtools can report every layer's idea of a terminal's size at once.
 *
 * Why this exists: a terminal can end up with its PTY and its xterm grid at
 * DIFFERENT widths, and when that happens nothing recovers it - xterm only emits
 * a resize when its own size changes, so a mismatch has no path back and the
 * terminal stays wrapped or clipped until the window is resized by hand. That
 * state was effectively invisible: the renderer knows only its grid, main knows
 * only the PTY, and neither compares. Diagnosing it meant measuring `.xterm-screen`
 * pixel widths off screenshots and doing arithmetic, which is slow and easy to
 * get wrong.
 *
 * Registering the live `Terminal` objects here lets one devtools call put the
 * renderer's grid next to main's PTY dimensions and derive the invariants
 * directly.
 *
 * Lives in shipped `utils/` rather than `src/devtools/` deliberately: shipped code
 * must never import from the devtools tree, and `useTerminal` is the only place
 * that can know when a terminal mounts. Same shape as the neighbouring
 * `terminal-capture-registry` - a cheap registry here, with the dev-only READ
 * installed from `src/devtools/`.
 *
 * Every WRITE is gated on `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`, so production collapses them to
 * no-ops. Most readers (`readTerminalGrids`, `readTerminalGridRows`,
 * `readTerminalRendererTrace`) are called from `src/devtools/renderer/install.tsx`,
 * which production dead-code-eliminates - so without the guard this would maintain
 * a registry and a 300-entry ring that nothing in a packaged build could ever read.
 *
 * Two readers now have SHIPPED call sites: `useTerminal` reads
 * `readSessionViewportRows` for the repaint nudge's before/after comparison and
 * `readSessionScrollRegion` for a replay trace detail. Neither changes the
 * calculus, because the write gate leaves `registered` empty in production, so
 * both return their empty forms there - and both call sites are themselves
 * dev-gated (a `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` ternary, and a trace thunk that only runs
 * inside the guard). Keep it that way: a shipped reader whose RESULT drives
 * product behavior is what would force the write gate to be dropped.
