/**
 * Which sessions this renderer currently has an xterm MOUNTED for, published to
 * main as a whole-set replace (`sessions.setMounted`).
 *
 * Why this is not the focused set: focus answers "is the user looking at it",
 * and main uses it to gate PTY data. Mounting answers "is something holding a
 * grid", which is a different question with a harder consequence. A PARKED
 * terminal (Backlog view, a window occluded by a maximized one) is unfocused
 * yet still mounted at its own cols/rows, and xterm re-sends dimensions only
 * when its OWN size changes - so if main reshapes that PTY underneath it, the
 * two disagree with no path back and the reveal replays a frame drawn for a
 * grid the terminal no longer has. Main therefore leaves a MOUNTED session's
 * grid alone (see SessionManager.scheduleRestingGridRestore).
 *
 * Published from the terminals themselves rather than derived from view state:
 * the mount lifecycle is the fact, and every surface that grows a terminal
 * later gets this for free instead of needing another visibility rule.
 *
 * Shipped, unlike the neighbouring dev-only terminal-grid-registry: main
 * depends on this in every build.

/** Refcounted: two panes can legitimately hold the same session (an inactive

 *
 *  Preserved across HMR (Pattern A, mirroring parked-terminals.ts). The
 *  registration lives in initTerminal, which runs once per xterm construction
 *  and never re-runs on a Fast Refresh - so a reset Map here would hold
 *  claims only in the DISCARDED module instance, and the next registration
 *  from the fresh instance would publish a whole-set replace that erased
 *  every still-mounted claim. Main would then read a parked-but-mounted
 *  terminal as unheld and reshape its grid underneath it, which is the exact
