 * Frozen task rows for RETAINED task-detail windows.

 * A retained window belongs to a backgrounded project, and the board store is
 * project-scoped, so its live task lookup misses. The window must keep
 * rendering anyway (its Browser pane's `<webview>` guest dies if the subtree
 * unmounts), so it falls back to the row captured at retention time.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a Zustand store: nothing subscribes to it. A retained window
 * renders from a stable frozen reference and must NOT re-render as the active
 * project's board churns, which is the difference between "a backgrounded pane
 * is idle" and "every board update re-renders windows the user cannot see".
 *
 * The session store is not mirrored here on purpose: `sessions.list()` is
 * deliberately unscoped (it feeds the sidebar's cross-project counts), so a
 * backgrounded task's session still resolves live and only the task row is
 * missing.

 * Which windows must be newly retained for the project being backgrounded, and

 *
 * Pure and exported so the multi-project case is unit-testable: the bug this
 * guards needs THREE projects (or a cache-cold switch back) to reproduce, and is
 * invisible to a test that hands `retainWindows` an already-correct anchor list.
 *
 * The two sets are deliberately NOT the same, and collapsing them into one
 * breaks the feature in one direction or the other:
 *  - `retainAnchors` covers only windows of the project being backgrounded NOW.
 *    `browserOpenTasks` is neither project-keyed nor ever cleared, so a window
 *    already retained for an EARLIER project still matches it; passing that
 *    anchor on would re-stamp the window with this switch's project id and point
 *    its pane at another project's URL sidecar.
 *  - `snapshotTaskIds` additionally keeps every ALREADY-retained window, whose
 *    frozen row must not be pruned. Losing it makes `getRetainedTask` return
 *    null, and `WindowContent` then renders the "no longer available"
 *    placeholder INSTEAD of the task-detail subtree, unmounting the very
 *    `<webview>` guest retention exists to keep alive.
