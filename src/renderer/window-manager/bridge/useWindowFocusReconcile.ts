/**
 * Keeps keyboard focus inside the window group when a window closes. If closing a
 * window orphans the focus - the focused element lived inside it, so
 * `document.activeElement` falls back to <body> after the close - this moves focus
 * to the most-recently-active remaining window's terminal. The focus cue + blinking
 * cursor follow, so a docked group keeps an active pane, like closing the focused
 * tab in a tab group hands focus to a sibling. Mounted once by WindowLayer.
 *
 * It only steps in when the close ACTUALLY orphaned focus: if focus still lives
 * somewhere valid (another window, a dialog), it leaves it alone, so it never
 * steals focus from where the user is working.
