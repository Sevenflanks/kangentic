/**
 * Pure policy resolver for click-outside (light-dismiss). Given the dismiss
 * policy and the current window set, return the ids of the windows a clean
 * empty-board click should close. The detection hook (`useClickOutsideToClose`)
 * owns the "was this a clean board-background click" decision; this function
 * owns only the policy-to-targets mapping, so it stays a pure, total, easily
 * unit-tested function.
 *
 *  - `off`     never closes anything.
 *  - `single`  closes the lone window whenever exactly one is open, in ANY state
 *              (the peek case). Note this makes dismissal COUNT-DEPENDENT: opening
 *              a second task silently turns background-close off with no visible
 *              cause, which is why `focused` is the default instead. With a single
 *              window there are no siblings to reflow, so the old floating-only gate
 *              was too strict: a window left `snapped` after its dock partner closed
 *              (evictWindowFromTiling keeps the lone survivor snapped, by design)
 *              still leaves empty board to click, and a lone maximized window covers
 *              only the board while the toolbar, sidebar, and status bar (all inside
 *              the board's dismiss scope) stay exposed beside it, so a click there
 *              still dismisses it as intended.
 *  - `focused` closes the focused window, regardless of how many are open and
 *              regardless of its state. THE DEFAULT: it removes `single`'s
 *              count-dependence, so the focused window closes whether one or five
 *              are open and repeated clicks close them in order.
 *  - `all`     closes every open window, regardless of state.
