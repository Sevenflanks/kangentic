/**
 * Window-manager store (Zustand) - a content-agnostic FACTORY.
 *
 * `createWindowManagerStore(options)` builds one independent instance: its own
 * windows, floating z-order, focused window, and tiling tree, plus its own
 * monotonic id space (so two layers never collide on a window/tile id or a
 * `data-testid` DOM query). The app mounts TWO instances - the board task-detail
 * layer and the command-terminal layer - each with its own persistence target.
 *
 * Renderer-only state: there is no IPC truth to re-sync, so HMR uses Pattern E
 * (pin the instance in `import.meta.hot.data` and self-accept). Pinning the
 * instance preserves the live layout AND the in-closure id counters across a Fast
 * Refresh, so an open window never vanishes or re-collides while dogfooding. The
 * settled layout is persisted by each layer's own bridge (see `persistence/`).
