 * build would silently dial plaintext loopback (`ws://127.0.0.1:8080`) instead
 * of falling back to the hosted relay - the Select simply not OFFERING 'local'
 * in production does not protect a config value that predates the build that
 * reads it.
 *
 * Both the dialer (`resolveRelayUrl` below) and the settings Select read this,
 * not `inferRelayMode`, so the gate lives in ONE place. That matters for the
 * UI as much as the dial: `MobileDevicesTab`'s Select only renders its 'local'
 * <option> in a dev build, so binding it to a raw 'local' would leave a
 * controlled <select> whose value matches no option - a blank dropdown sitting
