/**
 * The terminal fit invariant, exercised by the rapid open/close cycle that breaks
 * it in practice.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: an xterm's rendered grid must never be wider than the box showing
 * it. `.xterm-screen` width <= `.xterm-viewport` clientWidth. When it is wider the
 * right-hand column is cut off and a horizontal scrollbar appears, which is the
 * "opens un-resized" report - and because xterm re-sends dimensions only when its
 * OWN size changes, an overflowing grid has no path back: no refit is triggered, so
 * the terminal stays wrong until the window is resized by hand.
 *
 * SECOND INVARIANT: one detail-open should produce exactly ONE grid width. Two
 * means the mount fitted twice, so the PTY was resized twice, the agent repainted
 * twice, and the user watched the second repaint land - the "opens like this, then
 * refits" report. Counted from xterm's own `.xterm-screen` inline width via a
 * MutationObserver (see startGridWidthRecorder): pure DOM, so it works in the
 * production builds CI runs, where the devtools bridge is tree-shaken away, and on
 * Windows, where the fixture's own resize log cannot fill at all.
 *
 * WHY E2E AND NOT UI TIER: this needs a real PTY. A real agent produces real
 * content, which is what makes the viewport scroll and the geometry settle the way
 * it does at runtime; the UI tier's mock has no PTY and cannot reproduce any of it.
 *
 * WHY A REPAINTING TUI FIXTURE: plain `mock-claude` never repaints, so it has no
 * race, so this harness went GREEN against it while the real app flickered - it
 * proved nothing. `MOCK_CLAUDE_TUI_REPAINT=1` makes the fixture behave like Claude's
 * renderer in the ways that matter: alt screen, a full-screen erase per frame, a
 * DEC 2026 synchronized frame, and a DELAYED repaint on SIGWINCH so the agent's
 * redraw can land after the renderer has already sampled scrollback.
 *
 * WHY PURE DOM AND NOT THE DEVTOOLS ROUTE: `/terminal-state` reports this invariant
 * (plus the PTY-vs-grid half the DOM cannot see), but the inspection bridge is
 * tree-shaken out of production builds and CI builds production - a route-based
 * assertion would SKIP on CI and gate nothing. `.xterm-screen` and
 * `.xterm-viewport` are real DOM in every build, so this runs everywhere.
 * Use `kangentic_devtools_terminal_state` for the richer cross-process picture
 * when investigating locally against a dev build.
 *
 * WHY RAPID CYCLES: a single open is not enough. The failure needs the handoff to
 * race - the bottom panel and the detail window fitting to different widths while a
 * repaint is in flight - so the loop opens and closes with a short dwell and checks
 * the invariant after every cycle, reporting the first cycle that breaks it.
