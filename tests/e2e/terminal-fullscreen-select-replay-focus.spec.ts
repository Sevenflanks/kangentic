/**
 * E2E regression guard: terminal input/focus disconnect at a fullscreen-TUI
 * select prompt across a scrollback replay.
 *
 * Reported live on task #290 (2026-07-08): at an interactive select prompt
 * (AskUserQuestion / plan approval) in Claude's default fullscreen (alt-screen)
 * TUI renderer, arrow keys and Enter appeared to do nothing. Clicking the
 * terminal instantly unfroze it, proving keys were never reaching the PTY
 * (the xterm textarea had lost DOM focus) rather than the display being
 * frozen. A second symptom - the real xterm cursor parked bottom-right,
 * disconnected from the TUI frame - showed the replay had painted into
 * xterm's NORMAL buffer instead of the alt buffer.
 *
 * Root cause (two coupled defects):
 *   1. A stale/overlapping scrollback replay's afterWrite callback could
 *      clobber a newer replay's pending flag before the newer one's own
 *      focus() ever ran (no generation guard inside afterWrite itself).
 *   2. getScrollback() re-asserted DEC private INPUT modes (#313) but never
 *      alt-screen (1049), so a fullscreen session's replay always landed in
 *      the normal buffer.
 *
 * `tests/fixtures/mock-claude.js` normally emits plain marker lines with no
 * terminal escape sequences at all, so it cannot reproduce a bug that only
 * exists in the alt-screen replay path. Setting MOCK_CLAUDE_FULLSCREEN_SELECT=1
 * switches it to a small interactive select-prompt harness: it enters the alt
 * screen buffer, turns on DECCKM, draws a 3-option menu, and moves the
 * highlight via a cursor-addressed, synchronized-output DIFF on arrow input --
 * never a full repaint - so a lost keystroke or a misplaced replay is
 * directly observable in the scrollback (the highlighted-option marker for
 * the NEXT option only ever appears if the keystroke actually reached the PTY).
 *
 * This spec drives real, focused Playwright keyboard events into the xterm
 * DOM (not a `sessions.write` IPC bypass), because the bug is specifically
 * about whether DOM focus lands - an IPC-direct write would pass regardless
 * of whether the fix is present.
 *
 * Manual ground-truth reproduction against the real Claude CLI:
 *   1. Launch Kangentic dev build. Start a task, park it at any interactive
 *      select prompt (AskUserQuestion, plan approval).
 *   2. Open/close the task-detail dialog (or resize the panel) to force a
 *      scrollback replay.
 *   3. Confirm arrow keys move the highlight and Enter selects, without
 *      needing to click the terminal first.

/**
 * One-time settle margin before the FIRST getScrollback() read of a freshly
 * spawned session (see the call site below for why this test needs one).
 *
 * PtyBufferManager batches raw PTY output behind a fixed 16ms flush timer
 * (session-manager.ts's onFlush -> firstOutputTracker.consume runs only
 * inside that flush). getScrollback() drains the session's pending
 * (not-yet-flushed) buffer as a side effect - `state.buffer = ''` in
 * PtyBufferManager.getScrollback, pinned by the "getScrollback drains
 * pending buffer" case in tests/unit/pty-buffer-manager.test.ts. The 16ms
 * flush timer, once armed by the first PTY chunk, fires unconditionally
 * later regardless of any getScrollback() call in between - but if that call
 * drains the buffer before the timer fires, the timer finds nothing to
 * deliver and skips its callback, so first-output detection never sees the
 * bytes that would have latched it.
 *
 * mock-claude's fullscreen-select harness writes its ENTIRE frame (including
 * the `\x1b[?25l` first-output trigger) in one stdout.write() and then parks
 * waiting on stdin, so this is a one-shot, all-or-nothing race per spawn: a
 * getScrollback() call that happens to land inside that single 16ms window
 * (which this test's very first, zero-delay poll can do, since it fires
 * immediately after moveTaskIpc() resolves and can coincide with the mock
 * CLI's own spawn+write timing under CI load) permanently starves first
 * output, and every later poll in the same test then finds the SAME
 * stuck-empty state for its whole timeout with no way to recover - this was
 * the CI flake this margin fixes.
 *
 * Waiting comfortably longer than the fixed 16ms interval before ever
 * reading scrollback closes the window: whatever data has already arrived
 * has had time to flush naturally, and data that has not arrived yet reads
 * as an (harmless, nothing-to-drain) empty buffer. This mirrors the accepted
 * PTY-resize-debounce fixed wait elsewhere in this suite - bridging a
 * hardcoded internal batch timer, not "wait and hope."
