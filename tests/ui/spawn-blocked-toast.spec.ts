/**
 * UI coverage for the `task:spawnBlocked` push.
 *
 * Create, promote, unarchive and MCP auto-spawn deliberately KEEP the task when
 * its branch checkout is blocked, and skip only the spawn. That makes "created
 * and silently not spawned" look identical to a healthy spawn, which is why the
 * main process pushes this event and the renderer toasts it.
 *
 * The task-MOVE path does not use this channel: it rejects the in-flight invoke
 * instead, which the board store already toasts. That half was verified by hand
 * in a preview against a real agent holding the checkout; this spec covers the
 * push half, which no other tier exercises.
 *
 * Tier: UI (headless Chromium). No PTY, no Electron main process.
