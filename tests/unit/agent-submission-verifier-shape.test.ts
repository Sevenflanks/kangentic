/**
 * Pins each agent adapter's `getSubmissionVerifier` VERDICT for both the
 * 'paste' and 'command-injection' contexts, its escalation tier, whether it
 * can verify a SLASH-prefixed submission, and whether its verifier requires a
 * captured agent session id.
 *
 * This test's value is that `null` is a DECLARED ANSWER, not an omission. A
 * verifier is what authorizes escalation, and escalation restarts the session
 * with the command as an argv prompt - which destroys live work. So an adapter
 * only earns a non-null command-injection verifier once its history has been
 * MEASURED to flush on submit rather than at turn-end
 * (`scripts/measure-injection-flush.mjs`; numbers in `docs/command-injection.md`).
 *
 * `escalates` is the SECOND gate, and it is deliberately stricter than the
 * first. A measurement says the CLI writes the record fast enough; it says
 * nothing about whether THIS adapter's resolver finds THAT record. Both
 * questions have to be answered live before a false negative is unlikely
 * enough to hand it a restart. See the tier table in docs/command-injection.md.
 *
 * `verifiesSlashSubmission` and `requiresAgentSessionId` pin the two other
 * declared capabilities that `prepareInjectionPlan`
 * (`src/main/transition-engine/injection-plan.ts`) reads directly off the
 * adapter, independent of whether a verifier exists at all - they describe the
 * SHAPE of the adapter's history, not whether it currently has one wired up.
 * Both default to `true` ("omitted or true means yes" per the interface doc
 * comment); only a handful of adapters declare the `false` opt-out.
 *
 * Adding a verifier without a measurement fails this test, and so does flipping
 * `escalates`, `verifiesSlashSubmission`, or `requiresAgentSessionId` without
 * evidence in the adapter's own doc comment. That is the point: it forces the
 * evidence to exist first.
