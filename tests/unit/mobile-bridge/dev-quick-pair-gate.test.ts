/**
 * Static-scan regression guard for the dev-quick-pair backdoor
 * (src/main/mobile-bridge/dev-quick-pair.ts).
 *
 * dev-quick-pair.ts adopts the mobile dev rig's phone key straight into the
 * signed roster with every capability granted, no SAS ceremony - a
 * deliberate dev-only backdoor that "must never exist in production" (its
 * own header). TWO sites must stay gated, not just one:
 *
 * 1. The CONSTRUCTION site (`new DevQuickPair(...)` in the constructor).
 *    This is the one that actually matters for esbuild's dead-code
 *    elimination: an unconditional `new DevQuickPair(...)` field initializer
 *    keeps the whole class (and its console.warn/log strings, roster-adopt
 *    logic, and file-watching mechanism) reachable in the production bundle
 *    even if every CALL to its methods is gated - the class merely never
 *    gets used, it does not get eliminated. This was a real, verified gap:
 *    the module shipped inert-but-present in a production build until the
 *    construction itself was moved behind `__KANGENTIC_DEV__ ? new
 *    DevQuickPair(...) : null` in the constructor.
 * 2. The `.reconcile()` CALL site, gated separately so a production build
 *    (where the field is always `null`) never invokes it.
 *
 * A THIRD, independent invariant guards the same dead-code-elimination goal
 * one level down, inside dev-quick-pair.ts itself: `devPairingDir()`'s
 * `.kangentic/mobile-dev-pairing` path is built INLINE inside the function
 * body, not as a top-level `const x = path.join(...)`. A top-level const
 * initialized by a function call is a call esbuild cannot prove
 * side-effect-free, so it survives tree-shaking (as a dangling string
 * literal) even once nothing else in the module is reachable. Re-hoisting it
 * back to module scope would silently reintroduce that leak, so it gets its
 * own scan below.
 *
 * This cannot be a behavioral test: __KANGENTIC_DEV__ is a compile-time
 * substitution, and vitest.config.ts pins it to `false`, so the gated branch
 * is simply dead code at test time - a runtime assertion could not observe
 * whether either gate is still there or was accidentally removed. A source
 * scan is the only way to pin this, mirroring esbuild-cjs-imports.test.ts's
 * approach for a similarly compile-time-only invariant.
