/**
 * Harness for the open-a-task-detail flicker: black -> WRONG frame -> right frame.
 *
 * The pipeline on a handoff from the bottom panel to a detail window is:
 *
 *   1. renderer fits the new container      -> window cols (narrower than the panel)
 *   2. `sessions.resize(windowCols)`        -> SIGWINCH; the agent will repaint, async
 *   3. `getScrollback()` in parallel        -> awaits waitForResizeRepaint, then samples
 *   4. replay written into the fresh xterm  -> THE FIRST THING THE USER SEES
 *   5. live bytes were HELD during 3-4 (`shouldHold: scrollbackPendingRef`) and are
 *      flushed by `queue.kick()` at the end of `afterWrite`
 *
 * So whatever step 3 samples is the frame the user sees first, and anything the
 * agent sent that step 3 missed arrives at step 5 as a visible correction. If the
 * settle in step 3 returns before the repaint lands, the user necessarily sees the
 * pre-resize frame (drawn wide, wrapped into a narrow terminal) and then watches it
 * be replaced. That is exactly the reported sequence.
 *
 * The settle's early-exit marker is the suspect: it accepts a BARE `\x1b[H`
 * (cursor-home) as evidence of a full-frame repaint. Cursor-home is not that. A
 * fullscreen TUI emits it for ordinary partial updates - a spinner tick, redrawing
 * one line - so the very first routine update after the resize satisfies the
 * settle. Measured on a live Claude session: 169 cursor-homes vs 56 full-screen
 * clears in one 512KB ring, so the poison marker outnumbers the real one 3:1.
 *
 * This harness reproduces the race deterministically: a routine cursor-home lands
 * immediately after the resize, the genuine repaint lands later. A correct settle
 * waits for the repaint; the buggy one samples the stale frame in between.
