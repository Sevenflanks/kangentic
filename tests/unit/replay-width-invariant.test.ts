/**
 * Unit coverage for the two halves of one guarantee: a scrollback replay must
 * never leave a frame laid out for a width the grid does not have.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT. A task-detail window's terminal came back hard-wrapped from a
 * Board -> Backlog -> Board round trip: a 210-column agent frame rendered as if
 * the grid were 191, with the TUI's full-width rules spilling onto a second row.
 * It never self-corrected, because the frame lives in xterm's ALTERNATE buffer
 * and xterm reflows the normal buffer on resize and never the alternate one.
 *
 * THE CAUSE, measured from the merged devtools trace on a 1483px window:
 *
 *   terminal-park
 *   webgl-suspend      reason: budget
 *   terminal-reveal
 *   fit  reload-initial     cols 191  colsBefore 210  hostWidth 1482.796875
 *   replay-write            cols 191                       <-- 210-col frame
 *   fit  reload-after-replay cols 210 colsBefore 191 hostWidth 1482.796875
 *   webgl-resume       attached: true
 *
 * The container never moved (hostWidth is byte-identical across all three), so
 * this is a CELL METRIC change, not a layout one. FitAddon derives columns from
 * `_renderService.dimensions.css.cell.width`, and parking a terminal disposes
 * its WebGL addon for the GPU budget; the DOM renderer it falls back to measures
 * a wider cell, so the same box proposes fewer columns. The reveal's fit ran on
 * a renderer the terminal was about to stop using.
 *
 * TWO GUARDS, because they fail differently:
 *
 * 1. PREVENTION (the ordering scan below). Attach the renderer before publishing
 *    the reveal, so a fit is only ever taken on the renderer the terminal keeps.
 *    This is the fix; it is one statement order in one file and trivially
 *    undone, which is why it is pinned mechanically.
 * 2. BACKSTOP (`resolveReplayWidthAction`). Even with the ordering right, the
 *    width can move across a replay's async gap for reasons this fix does not
 *    cover (a live container resize, a font apply). The backstop re-issues the
 *    replay once, so the bug class stays self-healing rather than depending on
 *    guard 1 alone.
